# Shah-Sans
Python generated variable font

# Future Expansion
- issues
	- dieresis x coordinates switching when width is smaller
	- round corners getting shorter than the thickness when r<0.1 (maybe minR should be 0.05?)
	- glyph_t
	- g missing rounded serif on top
	- glyph_k is very weird looking
	- cedilla height distorts on t<25
	- cedilla width distorts on w<400
- make ascender and descender variable axes
- make rounded serifs components? (like in glyphs) this way they could be adjusted with the r value
- kerning ???
- ligatures ???
- dots could get boxier on less roundness
