# Shah-Sans
Shah Sans is a python generated variable font. Inspired by the shape-shifting mythical creature of the Middle East; Shahmaran, Shah Sans is a typeface in the form of a python script, that generates a variable typeface with 4 axes and counting. The design goal is to create a construction that is suitable for a highly variable typeface, ready for future expansion, in terms of adding more axes in the future. The use of the script instead of a fixed font file is used for this purpose. The typeface itself is the script, and it is the method of writing the code, that develops and grows with the typeface itself. This method right now is used right now in order to develop the typeface to a full Latin-ext letter set.
